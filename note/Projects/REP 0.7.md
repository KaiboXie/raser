Discussed with Kai, Yuhang, Tao, decided to create the software. 

Starting with KDetSim. 

Candidate names:

- Radiation Hard Semiconductor Devices Simulator
- RHSDS
 - RadDevSim
 - RASER - RAdiatin SEmiconductoR
- RADISIM
- RASES - RAdiatin SEmiconductor Simulator
- RADISC - RADIation Semiconductor Craft
- SCDS - Silicon Carbide Detector Simulator
- SIDESR - SIc DEtector SimulatoR 

Need to be inclusive, not just SiC. 

Talked with Chen, decided to user RASER.
