# Recruit, Select, and Train Members 

[[史欣]] 

- Goal:  recruit, select, and train the ==right== members to build a strong team!  

## Recruit 


- Kechuang Project 
- Member universities and institutes
- Public Lecture
- Word of mouth 

## Select

The true selection happens naturally with several milestones in the first ==3== months (90 days): 

- M1:  Create proper member's name with two key elements - REPs, Weekly Plan （ability to plan, execute, communicate and integrate into team) 
- M2:  Journal Club (ability to select and develop research topic)
- M3:  Team Report (ability to present research work in a professional way in English)


## Train 

- Organize two weekly trainings every year: winter and summer 
- Everyone can join remotely (will be recorded)
- Selected members can join locally
