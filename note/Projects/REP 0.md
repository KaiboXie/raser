# Index of Raser Enhancement Proposals (REPs) 

[[史欣]]


## Introduction 

The idea of REP is borrowed from PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals). 
This REP contains the index of all Raser Enhancement Proposals, know as REPs.  


## REP Number Scheme


- O -- Orgnization (0.X)
- H -- Hardware (1.X)
- S -- Software (2.X)
- P -- Publication (3.X)

The reason to use digits is to allow natural increase for each digit naturally and possible break down into sub items in the future. 

For example, a hardware task 1.2, can be broken into 1.2.1 to manufacture, 1.2.2 for IV, CV test, 1.2.3 for laser scan, etc.
