## Why new tools? 

- Why bother to create new tools? (not just think new concepts)


>  New directions in science are launched by new tools much more often than by new concepts. The effect of a concept-driven revolution is to explain old things in new ways. The effect of a tool-driven revolution is to discover new things that have to be explained"           -- Freeman Dyson

## Why aim so high?  

(radiation hard, fast timing, high spacial resolution) (What if we can’t get there? What if ...)

> The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark" -- Michelangelo 


> Aim high or we will not realize the potential of our field, discovery will be stalled and we ==betray== ourselves and the next generation.
