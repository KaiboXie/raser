# Single Photon Counting Spatial Uniformity of 4H-SiC APD Characterized by SNOM-Based Mapping System

DIOI: 10.1109/LPT.2017.2735625

### Abstract
In this letter, a mapping system based on a scanning near field optical microscope is built to characterize the single photon counting spatial uniformity of single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPAD), which is important for device physics study and process optimization. The system comprises of a passive quenching circuit module and a mapping module, which are used to record single photon count (SPC) signals and to scan over the SPAD photo-sensitive area, respectively. Meanwhile, 4H-SiC UV SPADs with positive beveled mesa are designed and fabricated. For the first time, 2-D mapping of SPC uniformity of 4H-SiC SPADs is carried out at different over-bias voltages. The possible reasons for the observed SPC non-uniformity across the active area of the 4H-SiC SPAD are discussed.

The distance between the SNOM tip and the SPAD surface is kept at ∼2 μm, resulting a light spot size of ∼1 μm. (If the tip-to-surface distance is further reduced in future, the spatial resolution of the mapping system can be considerably enhanced down to sub-micron scale.)

- The fabrication procedure begins with mesa etching, which is conducted in an inductively coupled plasma etching system with CF4/O2 as the etching gas. Using a photoresist reflow technique, the device mesa inherits the shape of the photoresist. A positive beveled mesa with a small slope angle of ∼5$^o$ is achieved.
- The device surface is then passivated by thermal oxidation at 1050 °C in O2 atmosphere followed by 500 nm SiO2 layer deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 350 °C.
- The device surface is then passivated by thermal oxidation at 1050 °C in O2atmosphere followed by 500 nm SiO2 layer deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 350 °C.
- a thick metal pad layer based on Ti/Au (200 nm/800 nm) bi-layer is deposited for electrical probing.

### Current gain
The avalanche gain (M) is calculated by the following equation:
$$
M=\frac{I_{\mathrm{ph}}-I_{\mathrm{dark}}}{I_{\mathrm{ph} \text { (unity) }}-I_{\mathrm{dark}(\text { unity) }}}
$$
where $I_{\mathrm{ph} \text { (unity) }}$,and $I_{\mathrm{dark}(\text { unity) }}$ are the un-multiplied photocurrent and dark current measured at 100 V, while $I_{ph}$ and $I_{dark}$ are the multiplied photocurrent and dark current at avalanche breakdown voltage.

### Dark counts and photon counts
Large gain dispersion in SPADs is undesirable for achieving high SPDE, which might be caused by electrical field nonuniformity across the device active area.

- Since the device diameter is only 120 μm, variation of layer thickness and doping density is unlikely to be the major cause of the asymmetric image within such a small length scale. Thus, tolerance encountered during the SPAD fabrication process could be the main cause of the local Vbr variation.
- Bevel angle variation is common in micro-fabrication procedure, as the structure is made based on a photoresist reflow technique, which is relatively hard to control.
- The carrier drift velocity along the <0001> direction is considerably lower than that along the $<11\bar{2}0>$ direction under the same electrical field. As a result, the impact ionization coefficient along the <0001> direction is smaller than that along the $<11\bar{2}0>$direction.
- α is not equal to β. As a result, the carrier acceleration and multiplication process should be slightly different between the two sides of the mesa, which might partly explain the asymmetric multiplication image observed along $<11\bar{2}0>$.

Note: at present the exact mechanism for the non-uniform SPC signal strength distribution is not clear and still under investigation, which could be caused by a combined effect of processing-related structural imperfection and off-cut related anisotropic electrical transport.

### Conclusion
In this work, a SNOM-based mapping system is developed to characterize the SPC spatial uniformity of SPADs, which is helpful for understanding the related device physics and improving the device performance through process optimization. The system is used to characterize a 4H-SiC UV SPAD and the possible reasons for the observed SPC non-uniformity across the active area of the 4H-SiC SPAD are discussed. The advantage of this technique is that mapping single photon counting characteristics across the SPAD active area is firstly realized, which directly links to the performance of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operating in Geiger mode. Comparatively, past photocurrent mapping study only reflects the performance of APDs operating in linear mode. Another disadvantage of the photocurrent mapping technique is that to obtain reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio, relatively strong light beam has to be used, which itself would disturb the APD performance due to strong carrier screening effect.
