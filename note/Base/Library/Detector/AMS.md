Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer

AMS计划，即阿尔法磁谱仪计划（Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer），是由1976年诺贝尔奖获奖者、著名美籍华裔物理学家、台湾“中央研究院”院士、美国麻省理工学院丁肇中教授领导的，由全球包括美国、中国、俄罗斯、意大利、瑞士、德国等16个国家和地区的56个研究机构、1500多名科研人员参与合作承担的国际性大型科研项目，造价约7亿美元。这是人类第一次在太空中使用粒子物理精密探测仪器和技术的实验。对人类认识宇宙的形成机理有着极其重要的意义。

On the cover of this issue, NASA astronaut Drew Morgan is photographed 400 km above Earth’s surface installing a new coolant system for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) during a crucial spacewalk on 2 December. Masterminded by charm–quark co-discoverer Sam Ting of MIT, and assembled and overseen by an international team at CERN, AMS has been attached to the International Space Station since 2011. Its various subdetectors, which include a silicon tracker embedded in a 0.15 T magnet, have so far clocked up almost 150 billion charged cosmic rays with energies up to the multi-TeV range and produced results that contradict conventional understanding. The new coolant system (which was delivered by an Antares rocket on 2 November) will extend the lifetime of AMS until the end of the decade, allowing more conclusive statements to be made about the origin of the unexpected observations. A full report on the unprecedented AMS intervention – and a taste of the experiment’s latest results – will appear on cerncourier.com following the final extravehicular activity by Drew and his colleagues in mid-January.
