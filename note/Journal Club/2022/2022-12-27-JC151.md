## Development of Beam Conditions Monitor for the ATLAS experiment

---

- JC151 introduced a paper about Beam Condition Monitor(BCM) in ATLAS LHC.
 
- The paper introduces a beam condition monitor designed for ATLAS LHC. BCM system is used to detect early sign of beam failure and trigger a beam abort when beam failure happens. BCM uses pCVD diamond in the detector module, and put four modules around the beam. Then the paper introduces the readout system. BCM uses NINO ASIC chips to convert analog signal to digital signal and send to FPGA. Then the paper shows the IV test results of the pCVD diamond, and the result of irradiation. They also test the board using proton test beam and show the result. 

- In conclusion, in the field of detecting very high energy proton beam, they have designed a successful scheme to get beam fluence using pCVD diamonds and have proved it.

## Introduction to LHC beam

 - LHC proton beam:
	 - energy:1.6TeV
	 - bunch:1.1e11 protons
	 - vertical spread:380$\mu m$
	 - bunch interval:25ns
	 - run time:10e7 seconds per year

## Purpose of building BCM

- Monitoring beam situation, provide real-time fluence and luminosity
- Detect early signs of beam failure, and prevent sensors from beam failure
	- When beam failure happens, trigger a beam abort
