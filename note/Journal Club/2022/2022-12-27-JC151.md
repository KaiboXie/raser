## Development of Beam Conditions Monitor for the ATLAS experiment
    Author: Irena Dolenc

 The paper introduces a beam condition monitor designed for ATLAS LHC. BCM system is used to detect early sign of beam failure and trigger a beam abort when beam failure happens. BCM uses pCVD diamond in the detector module, and put four modules around the beam. Then the paper introduces the readout system. BCM uses NINO ASIC chips to convert analog signal to digital signal and send to FPGA. Then the paper shows the IV test results of the pCVD diamond, and the result of irradiation test
