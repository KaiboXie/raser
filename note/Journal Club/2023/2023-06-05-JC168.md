作者设计了两种电荷灵敏放大器（PA1,PA2）,并将其放置到了由三种不同材料{FR4,Teflon(聚四氟乙烯)，ceramic（陶瓷材料）}}的基板上，比较了几种情况下的CSA的ENC和灵敏度。最后，在有辐照损伤的情况下测试了几种电路的性能。

结型场效应管（JFET）的选择：
 为了减轻栅极漏电流波动带来的输入==电流噪声==和漏极电流波动带来的==散粒噪声== 以及==(1/f)噪声==，两种前置放大器设计都选用了极低栅极漏极电流和小输入电容的JFET。
PA1与PA2区别：PD2以集成运放来代替双极型三极管，以求在保证低噪声的情况下提高其灵敏度

- 电路仿真
   工具： OrCAD Pspice simulator 
   输入信号：实验条件下Si-PIN探测器(1 cm 1 cm × 0.5 mmt)上入射662 keV能量时的感                                     应电流值
   输出信号：![output.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/output.png)
  无论是PA1还是PA2，其输出信号的高度都随着反馈电容的大小（C<sub>f</sub>）的增大而减小
  $$A_{CQ}=1/C_F $$ 
  电荷收集效率：
  $$CCE=(ΔV_{out}\times\frac{C_f}{Q_in})\times100\%$$

 电荷收集效率(CCE)作为反馈电容的函数，表明输入端的电荷对输出端了脉冲输高度的影响，PA2的灵敏度更高，性能也更加稳定。

- 电路测试
  等效噪声电荷（ENC）测试：MCA（多通道分析仪）
  V<sub>CSA</sub> 的计算：
  ![Vcsa.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/Vcsa.png)
  we adopted the MCA (multi-channel analyzer) method to obtain the ENC noise of the CSA, by measuring V<sub>N</sub>  (mV) and V <sub>M</sub>(mV); here, V<sub>N</sub> and V <sub>M</sub>  are the noise voltage outputs from the shaping amplifier (572A, ORTEC) which has CR-(RC)<sup>4</sup>  and 0.5 ms of peak time for the Si-PIN detector with and without using the CSA, respectively.
 $$V_{CSA}=\sqrt{(V_N)^2-(V_M)^2}$$
 ENC的计算：
 $$ENC=\frac{V_{CSA}\times C_T\times V_T\times 2.35\times W}{V_P\times q}$$  
 $$ΔE = W * ENC$$ 
 影响ENC的因素：
 The signal delay, noise, and power consumption of CSA all depend on the dielectric constant of the separating insulator. Therefore, capacitive coupling of signal and cross talk between the
 interconnection will cause signal delay and increase the noise. The relative dielectric constant (ε’), a dissipation factor (D<sub>f</sub> ) at 1 GHz, called a loss tangent (tand), and Df values per unit thickness (D<sub>f</sub> / mm) of each material used in this study are shown in Table 1. ![屏幕截图 2023-06-01 154316.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%202023-06-01%20154316.png)
 灵敏度（sensitivity）：文章中并未指明测量灵敏度的具体方式，只是阐述了影响灵敏度的因    素。
 The velocity (v’) of the signal and the effective capacitance (Ceff) of the transmission line on the substrate have the following relationships: 
 $$v^,=\frac{c}{\sqrt{ε_r}}$$  $$ C_{eff}=ε_r\frac{\frac{W}{T}}{H}L$$ 
 
 where c is the velocity of light in free space (3$\times10^8$ m/s), ==ε<sub>r</sub>== is the relative permittivity of material between signal lines, W, L, and T are the width, the length and the thickness of the transmission line (W is 0.5 mm and T is relatively lower than W), and H is the thickness of the substrate. The lower the dielectric constant ( ε<sub>r</sub> ), the higher the ==characteristic impedance== , with ==less crosstalk and propagation delay==  , which leads to a faster rise time and larger signal gain of CSA. ==Thicker substrates==  for CSA will have lower ==input capacitance== , and thus, make the sensitivity higher.

 Teflon- and ceramic-based PA1 show better noise performance than the FR4-based one, but the Teflon-based PA1 shows b0etter sensitivity than the ceramic-based one.
 ==In order to minimize electronic noise of the detection system which enhance energy resolution, one would prefer to use low capacitance detectors. And this is why the radiation sensor and CSA are closely connected with respect to reducing the total input capacitance.== 
 Since the dissipation factor of Teflon is smaller than others, which leads to a small capacitance in the total input capacitance, the sensitivity of Teflon-based CSA could be higher than other substrate material based ones when the detector capacitance is under 1 nF.
 ENC、灵敏度与shaping time、反馈电容（C<sub>f</sub> ）的关系（PA2）：![屏幕截图 2023-06-01 161331.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%202023-06-01%20161331.png)Because higher sensitivity can reduce noise factors from the other signal-processing chains,   particularly from the shaping amplifier that amplifies the signal and the noise at the
 same time before the DAQ system, the energy resolution can beenhanced. 
 When the shaping time was increased, ENC increased, but the sensitivity slightly decreased. In addition, when the feedback capacitance (Cfeedback) was increased with the same 2 ms peak
 time for the shaping amplifier, ENC increased and the sensitivity decreased.
 ==If the electronic noise of CSAs is to be minimized and the energy resolution of the detector system be enhanced, a short shaping time and a small feedback capacitance would be preferred for better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). ==

- 辐射测试：
   未接受辐照前PA1和PA2的能量分辨：![屏幕截图 2023-06-01 164419.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%202023-06-01%20164419.png)
  This shows that a higher sensitivity preamplifier is favorable for lowering total noise and enhancing energy resolution of the detection system as it requires less gain at the shaping amplifier which may also amplify the noise, as well as the signal.
  辐射对能量分辨的影响(PA1,after 10<sup>5</sup> Gy irradiation)：
  <sup>60</sup> Co irradiators were used to deliver low and high dose rates. For the delivery of doses from 10 to 100 Gy, a dose rate of 100 Gy/h was used, and for 10<sup>3</sup>  to10<sup>5</sup>  Gy, the dose was delivered with 3600 Gy/h. After irradiation, gamma-ray energy spectra of <sup>133</sup> Ba were obtained with the same 3* 3*0.68 mm<sup>3</sup>  Si PIN detector.
  ![屏幕截图 2023-06-01 165920.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%202023-06-01%20165920.png)
  辐射对CSA的ENC和敏感度的影响：![屏幕截图 2023-06-01 172330.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%202023-06-01%20172330.png)
Note that, although the noise characteristics and sensitivity of PA1 and PA2 are different, the tendency of noise and sensitivity variation after irradiation is almost the same for PA1 and PA2, not because of the influence of the integrated active components circuits (ICs) such as transistors and amplifiers, but because of the effective dissipation factor of each substrate. Therefore, the deviation of ENC and sensitivity is caused due to substrate radiation exposure because all CSAs use the same IC component.
