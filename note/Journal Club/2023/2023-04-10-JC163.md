#### Introduction
The paper introduces a beam monitor system based on SiC sensor coated with $^{6}$LiF converter, which has a high probability to react with thermal neutrons and result in alpha particle and triton, for CMRR neutron reflectometer. The NR is located at C3 cold neutron. The power of neutron source is about 20MW. The area of sensor is 10mm $\times$ 10mm and thickness of epitaxial is 30$\mu m$, which is sufficient to discriminate gamma background. They measured I-V and alpha responses of the sensor before assembling. Then, the SiC detector and $^{6}$LiF converter are installed in a small aluminum shielding box and measured their neutron and gamma responses with Am–Li neutron source and a $^{137}$Cs plus $^{60}$Co gamma source. In order to get neutron flux, they count distinct triton peaks to get normalized data.

#### Detector fabrication
reasons to use SiC:
Produce no measurable scattering effects
Suitable neutron detection efficiency, and sufficient measurement statistics
High accuracy, stability and longevity performances
Excellent discrimination ability against the gamma ray background

The structure of SiC:

The energies of the alpha and triton particles released by interactions with thermal neutrons are 2050 and 2730 keV, and the average ranges of 2730 keV triton particles and 2050 keV alpha particles in SiC are 28 $\mu m$ and 4.9 $\mu m$. Thus, thickening the $^{6}$LiF increasers the efficiency of detecting triton and degrades energy resolution. They believe 1$\mu m$ is the best thickness.

#### Test results
##### I-V:

The charges were fully collected at 20V, when the epitaxial layer was the full depletion depth. Noise is high due to 350pF capacitance.

##### alpha:

the energy resolution was 1.4% at 7687 keV

##### neutron spectrum with Am-Li, thickness of $^{6}$LiF : 1$\mu m$ and 21$\mu m$

21$\mu m$ cannot distinguish alpha and triton
1$\mu m$ can easily distinguish them

##### neutron and gamma spectrum:

Low energy gamma background can be easily discriminated from neutron signal alpha and triton.
The spectrum sharply decreases at approximately 2730 because tritons are generated on the $^{6}$LiF surface facing the SiC detector.

##### Spectrum obtained by SiC sensor at neutron reflectometer at CMRR

The data were collected for 1350 s at a CMRR power of about 15 MW, and the neutron flux was about $1.5\times10^{4} n/(s·cm^{2})$. The efficiency was determined as 0.28% from the triton peak. The accuracy of the neutron beam intensity was monitored by the counting rate of the triton peak area.

#### Conclusion
The article introduces a neutron beam monitor designed for CMRR, and tests its performance. We can see from the article that the SiC monitor has a good performance and can be successfully used in beam monitor.
