# A neutron beam monitor based on silicon carbide semiconductor coated with $^{6}$LiF converter

doi: 10.1016/j.nima.2018.12.014

The paper introduces a beam monitor system based on SiC sensor coated with $^{6}$LiF converter, which has a high probability to react with thermal neutrons and result in alpha particle and triton, for CMRR neutron reflectometer. The energy of neutron is 20MeV. The area of sensor is 10mm $\times$ 10mm and thickness of epitaxial is 30$\mu m$, which is sufficient to discriminate gamma background. They measured I-V and alpha responses of the sensor before assembling. Then, the SiC detector and $^{6}$LiF converter are installed in a small aluminum shielding box and measured their neutron and gamma responses. In order to get neutron flux, they use distinct triton peaks.
