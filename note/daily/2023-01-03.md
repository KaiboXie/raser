##  News and Plan 

-  Happy New Year! 2023 
- Will get rid off PPT/Slides in our future meetings 
	- Better to eliminate all of them in sub-group meetings as well 
	- More about this idea later 

##  What's wrong with PPT/Slides based group meetings? 

- Before the meeting: spend more time on writing/drawing/stying 
- During the meeting: content confined in just one page, not dynimic when the need to have more details. 
	- Staff: want to know more details to check if there is anything wrong
	- Junor: want to trace-down to some even basic information such as physics, math, computing, detector, etc. 
	- Presentor: has to hide/put them into backup 
- After the meeting: very hard to trace and integrate back to team knowledge base. 

## This happens to Journal Club as well! 

- Presenter already spend quite some time to read/collect informaiton
- Also spend quite some time in composing the slides
- After the JC, reluctant to converge them into webpage
	- Extra time wasted 
	- Higher-standard to get the jekylly webpage correct
- Even the JC content was put on the webpage, still not easy to obsorb or used by other team members in the future. 

##  So, how to solve these problem - fundermentally? 

- We should ask ourselves the quesion: what's the goal of group meeting? 
- What's the goal of JC? 
- Why all these matters? 
- Team Learning 

##  Team Learning with Obsidian 

- Introduction to [[Obsidian]] (OB)
- Future team meeting with OB 
- Not solved issue: media 
	- How to save and store pictures? 
- Next RASER Week for training?
