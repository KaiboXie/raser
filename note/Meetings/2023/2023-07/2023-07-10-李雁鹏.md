The current problem of T1 readout board is  that the β test has no signal.

---
## Possible Reason
- β source
-  The electrons of the beta source interact with the circuit board in a way that increases the noise
- T1 board magnification is lower than expected
- Crosstalk between transmission lines increases the noise
- The change in the  HV filter circuit increases the noise
- Detector failure
- ....

## The properties of beta sources:
The <sup>90</sup>Sr source emits β particles at 0.546 MeV from <sup>90</sup>Sr and at 2.280 MeV from   <sup>90</sup>Y
Activity of the beta source:

## UCSC  and  T1 Selection
- β source test:
    All T1 and UCSC boards have no output signals
- The output signal of the scintillator irradiated by the β source is added to the test port of the UCSC board:
     UCSC boards have no output signals
---
- laser test:
   T1 board #4 has a signal, and the rest of the T1 board and UCSC board have no signal
