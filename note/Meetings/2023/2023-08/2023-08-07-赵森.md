By solving the drift diffusion model, the carrier transport behavior of semiconductor devices under different bias voltages can be obtained, and the "current-voltage" characteristic curve (I-V curve) can be obtained


## CV

In capacitance measurement, a commonly used method is to measure the capacitance value using the 2π frequency doubling method (also known as the angular frequency method or frequency variation method).

The 2π frequency doubling method is measured based on the frequency response characteristics of the RC circuit. When an RC circuit receives a sine wave input signal, the voltage response of the capacitor changes with frequency. By measuring the voltage response of the capacitor and the frequency of the input signal, the capacitance value can be calculated.
