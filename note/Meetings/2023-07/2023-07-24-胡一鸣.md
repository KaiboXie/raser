- since we fix parameters by chisquare, there is some situation we can't fix by software alignment

- fit the residual with gauge distribution

- Q: Why the 1st and last residual much more than others? chips resolution differ or other reason？
---
- The measured residual is not the final residual of Chips'

- Some other check in track reconstrution: material budget
- In general, material budget is in relation to the scattering

- Using DFS(deepth first search) to accelerate clustering 
- ![dfs.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/dfs.png)
- Check the adjoin point around whether they belong to same cluster
- If they belong to the same cluster, check the adjoin point by the same way
---
- The Highland formula describes the relationship between the multiple scattering angles 𝜃 distribution and the material budget, as
- ![materials_budget.png](https://raser-1314796952.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/media/materials_budget.png)
- In first testbeam, beam only pass through chips, the material budget is too small for check

# Simulation process

- Build the detector G4 part follow the three levels:
	- Pixel: Define pixel structure，build its logic volumn for layer part
	- Layer:  Combine the pixels by rows&columns numbers, different layer can use different pixel
	- Telescope:  when we have mutiple layers, we can define their transition and rotation to build a whole telescope
