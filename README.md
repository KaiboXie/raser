RASER

Welcome to Fork and contribute!

Prerequisites
======

An environment with 

    ROOT
    Geant4
    python packages in `cfg/raser.def`
        
you need to change the ```dir_geant4_data``` and the ```GEANT4_INSTALL``` in cfg/setup.sh by your Geant4 data path and install path.
we recommand use apptainer and our .sif: https://ihepbox.ihep.ac.cn/ihepbox/index.php/s/Gp2SQIXLOUcKh4C

For external users, .sif should be in `img/`.

For developer using vscode, we recommand you follow this instruction to let Pylance able to read Python packages inside the .sif: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63604427/launching-a-singularity-container-remotely-using-visual-studio-code

Notice that if you need to mount a symbol link to the .sif while entering the .sif by vscode, you need to mount their real paths too.

Note: Python 3.9 is recommended. If your Python is of a higher version, you need to checkout a ROOT version compatible to the Python.

Before Run
======

While running raser you need in the directory of raser.

run steps:

    source cfg/setup.sh # before run
    raser-shell (or entering your own's python virtual environment)
    python3 src/raser <option <option tag>>

update:

    git pull

For internal users on lxlogin, use cfg/setup_lxlogin.sh instead.

Output
======

The output of raser will store inside <directory of raser>/output/ .

Run Options
======

checkout __main__.py for detail.
